# Glossary
* **Intrinsically disordered protein (IDP)**: a protein that lacks a fixed or ordered three-dimensional structure, typically in the absence of its macromolecular interaction partners, such as other proteins or RNA.
* **Conformational ensembles (aka Structural ensembles)**: experimentally constrained computational models describing the structure of intrinsically unstructured proteins.
* **Conformations**: the different 3-dimensional arrangements that the molecule can acquire by freely rotating around σ-bonds.
* **Sigma bonds (σ bonds)**: the strongest type of covalent chemical bond.
* **Solving IDP/IDR ensembles**: finding a set of IDP conformations that is a is a faithful representation of the real physical state of the IDP/IDR.
* **Radius of gyration**: the root-mean-square average of the distance of all scattering elements from the center of mass of the molecule.
* **Solvent exposure**: of an amino acid in a protein measures to what extent the amino acid is accessible to the solvent (usually water) surrounding the protein
* **Relative accessible surface area or relative solvent accessibility**: a measure of residue solvent exposure.
