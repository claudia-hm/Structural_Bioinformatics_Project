# Glossary
* **Intrinsically disordered protein (IDP)**: a protein that lacks a fixed or ordered three-dimensional structure, typically in the absence of its macromolecular interaction partners, such as other proteins or RNA.
* **Conformational ensembles (aka Structural ensembles)**: experimentally constrained computational models describing the structure of intrinsically unstructured proteins.
* **Conformations**: the different 3-dimensional arrangements that the molecule can acquire by freely rotating around σ-bonds.
* **Sigma bonds (σ bonds)**: the strongest type of covalent chemical bond.
